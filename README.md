# Hack-Bulgaria-Algorithms

  I decided to start programing at the age of 17, because my father is a programmer and I find it cool to be one. The thing I love most about programming is that it trains my brain and I find it fun to develop programs. And by doing fun I get educated at the same time, which is priceless. This thought motivates me every day to keep going on.
  
  I got keen to algorithmic thinking in a course, in the university that I study, which is called “Competitive programing”. 
  
  In the course of Algorithms in Hack Bulgaria I expect to have fun and to learn good and hard to implement algorithms. Generally I expect to get smarter and more dedicated to programing.
